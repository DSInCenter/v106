abstract: 'Glaucoma is the second leading global cause of blindness and its effects
  are irreversible, making early intervention crucial. The identification of glaucoma
  progression is therefore a challenging and important task. In this work, we model
  and predict longitudinal glaucoma measurements using an interpretable, discrete
  state space model. Two common glaucoma biomarkers are the retinal nerve fibre layer
  (RNFL) thickness and the visual eld index (VFI). Prior works have frequently used
  a scalar representation for RNFL, such as the average RNFL thickness, thereby discarding
  potentially-useful spatial information. We present a technique for incorporating
  spatiotemporal RNFL thickness measurements obtained from a sequence of OCT images
  into a longitudinal progression model. While these images capture the details of
  RNFL thickness, representing them for use in a longitudinal model poses two challenges:
  First, spatial changes in RNFL thickness must be encoded and organized into a temporal
  sequence in order to enable state space modeling. Second, a predictive model for
  forecasting the pattern of changes over time must be developed. We address these
  challenges through a novel approach to spatiotemporal progression analysis. We jointly
  model the change in RNFL with VFI using a CT-HMM and predict future measurements.
  We achieve a decrease in mean absolute error of 74% for spatial RNFL thickness encoding
  in comparison to prior work using the average RNFL thickness. This work will be
  useful for accurately predicting the spatial location and intensity of tissue degeneration.
  Appropriate intervention based on more accurate prediction can potentially help
  to improve the clinical care of glaucoma.'
