abstract: Early prediction of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimerâ€™s disease
  (AD) and related dementias is important in developing early medical supports and
  social supports, and may identify ideal stages for testing novel therapeutics aimed
  at preventing disease progression. Currently, a diagnosis is based on clinical expertise
  and cognitive screening tests, which have limited accuracy in earlier stages of
  disease, or invasive and resource-intensive testing, such as lumbar puncture or
  specialized neuroimaging. Changes in speech and language patterns can occur in dementia
  in its earliest stages and may worsen as the disease progresses. This has led to
  recent attempts to create automatic methods that predict dementia through language
  analysis. In addition to features extracted from language samples, previous works
  have improved the prediction accuracy by introducing some task-specific features.
  But task-specific features prevent the model from generalizing to other tests. In
  this paper, we apply a neural model (Hierarchical Attention Networks) to the dementia
  prediction task. Remarkably, the model requires no task-specific feature and achieves
  state-of-the-art classification result on a widely used dementia dataset of spoken
  language. We also perform a detail analysis to interpret how a prediction is made.
  Interestingly, the same neural model does not work well on a corpus of written text,
  suggesting that dementia prediction from language may require different methods
  depending on the genre of the source language.
