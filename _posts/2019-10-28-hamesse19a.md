abstract: Achilles Tendon Rupture (ATR) is one of the typical soft tissue injuries.
  Rehabilitation after such a musculoskeletal injury remains a prolonged process with
  a very variable outcome. Accurately predicting rehabilitation outcome is crucial
  for treatment decision support. However, it is challenging to train an automatic
  method for predicting the ATR rehabilitation outcome from treatment data, due to
  a massive amount of missing entries in the data recorded from ATR patients, as well
  as complex nonlinear relations between measurements and outcomes. In this work,
  we design an end-to-end probabilistic framework to impute missing data entries and
  predict rehabilitation outcomes simultaneously. We evaluate our model on a real-life
  ATR clinical cohort, comparing with various baselines. The proposed method demonstrates
  its clear superiority over traditional methods which typically perform imputation
  and prediction in two separate stages.
