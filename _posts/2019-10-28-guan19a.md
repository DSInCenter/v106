abstract: Reducing patients’ medical wait times by improving resource and staffing
  allocation is an important area of focus in hospital operations management. Two
  ways to decrease wait times are to adjust staffing or to limit the number of non-urgent
  visits to reflect a predicted volume of sick patients. Currently, this problem has
  been approached by both generalized linear models and time series models, and has
  mainly been researched in the context of adult emergency departments. We analyze
  sick visit data over a nine year period from one pediatric group (PG) that serves
  over 30,000 sick infants, children, and adolescents yearly in a walk-in and appointment-based
  out-patient clinic. The PG currently schedules staff and well-child appointments
  assuming a constant number of sick visits daily despite weekly and seasonal cycles
  in the data. We develop time series models to estimate the volume of sick patients
  that the PG can expect on any given day, so that clinicians can be allocated and
  the number of well-child appointments scheduled in advance can be adjusted according
  to predictions. First, we find that recurrent neural network (RNN) models are able
  to capture the seasonality of the data and perform substantially better than state-of-the-art
  models, including constant predictions. Next, we find that previous days’ data can
  be used to perform outbreak detection by identifying error outliers. Lastly, we
  find improvements in prediction when modeling sick patients as a mixture of disease
  types, because disease types are concentrated differently throughout the year. Resource
  allocation based on these findings can be expanded upon to reduce wait time by improving
  staffing at pediatric emergency departments and outpatient clinics.
