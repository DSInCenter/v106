abstract: Computational models that forecast the progression of Alzheimer’s disease
  at the patient level are extremely useful tools for identifying high risk cohorts
  for early intervention and treatment planning. The state-of-the-art work in this
  area proposes models that forecast by using latent representations extracted from
  the longitudinal data across multiple modalities, including volumetric information
  extracted from medical scans and demographic info. These models incorporate the
  time horizon, which is the amount of time between the last recorded visit and the
  future visit, by directly concatenating a representation of it to the latent data
  representation. In this paper, we present a model which generates a sequence of
  latent representations of the patient status across the time horizon, providing
  more informative modeling of the temporal relationships between the patient’s history
  and future visits. Our proposed model outperforms the baseline in terms of forecasting
  accuracy and F1 score.
