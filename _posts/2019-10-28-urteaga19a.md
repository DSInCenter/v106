abstract: We present an end-to-end statistical framework for personalized, accurate,
  and minimally invasive modeling of female reproductive hormonal patterns. Reconstructing
  and forecasting the evolution of hormonal dynamics is a challenging task, but a
  critical one to improve general understanding of the menstrual cycle and personalized
  detection of potential health issues. Our goal is to infer and forecast individual
  hormone daily levels over time, while accommodating pragmatic and minimally invasive
  measurement settings. To that end, our approach combines the power of probabilistic
  generative models (i.e., multi-task Gaussian processes) with the flexibility of
  neural networks (i.e., a dilated convolutional architecture) to learn complex temporal
  mappings. To attain accurate hormone level reconstruction with as little data as
  possible, we propose a sampling mechanism for optimal reconstruction accuracy with
  limited sampling budget. Our results show the validity of our proposed hormonal
  dynamic modeling framework, as it provides accurate predictive performance across
  different realistic sampling budgets and outperforms baselines methods.
