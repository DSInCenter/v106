abstract: Given the crucial role of microtubules for cell survival, many researchers
  have found success using microtubule-targeting agents in the search for effective
  cancer therapeutics. Understanding microtubule responses to targeted interventions
  requires that the microtubule network within cells can be consistently observed
  across a large sample of images. However, fluorescence noise sources captured simultaneously
  with biological signals while using wide-held microscopes can obfuscate fine microtubule
  structures. Such requirements are particularly challenging for high-throughput imaging,
  where researchers must make decisions related to the trade-off between imaging quality
  and speed. Here, we propose a computational framework to enhance the quality of
  high-throughput imaging data to achieve fast speed and high quality simultaneously.
  Using CycleGAN, we learn an image model from low-throughput, high-resolution images
  to enhance features, such as microtubule networks in high-throughput low-resolution
  images. We show that CycleGAN is effective in identifying microtubules with 0.93+
  AUC-ROC and that these results are robust to different kinds of image noise. We
  further apply CycleGAN to quantify the changes in microtubule density as a result
  of the application of drug compounds, and show that the quantified responses correspond
  well with known drug effects.
