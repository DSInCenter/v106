abstract: 'We consider the problem of clinical image classification for the purpose
  of aiding doctors in dermatological disease diagnosis. Diagnosis of dermatological
  conditions from images poses two major challenges for standard off-the-shelf techniques:
  First, the distribution of real-world dermatological datasets is typically long-tailed.
  Second, intra-class variability is large. To address the first issue, we formulate
  the problem as low-shot learning, where once deployed, a base classifier must rapidly
  generalize to diagnose novel conditions given very few labeled examples. To model
  intra-class variability effectively, we propose Prototypical Clustering Networks
  (PCN), an extension to Prototypical Networks (Snell et al. , 2017 ) that learns
  a mixture of “prototypes” for each class. Prototypes are initialized for each class
  via clustering and refined via an online update scheme. Classification is performed
  by measuring similarity to a weighted combination of prototypes within a class,
  where the weights are the inferred cluster responsibilities. We demonstrate the
  strengths of our approach in effective diagnosis on a realistic dataset of dermatological
  conditions.'
