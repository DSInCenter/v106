abstract: Seizure detection from EEGs is a challenging and time-consuming clinical
  problem that would benefit from the development of automated algorithms. EEGs can
  be viewed as structural time series, because they are multivariate time series where
  the placement of leads on a patientâ€™s scalp provides prior information about the
  structure of interactions. Commonly used deep learning models for time series do
  not offer a way to leverage structural information, but this would be desirable
  in a model for structural time series. To address this challenge, we propose the
  temporal graph convolutional network (TGCN), a model that leverages temporal and
  structural information and has relatively few parameters. TGCN applies feature extraction
  operations that are localized and shared over both time and space, thereby providing
  a useful inductive bias in tasks where similar features are expected to be discriminative
  across the different sequences. In our experiments we focus on metrics that are
  most important to seizure detection, and demonstrate that TGCN matches the performance
  of related models that have been shown to be state-of-the-art in other tasks. Additionally,
  we investigate interpretability advantages of TGCN by exploring approaches for helping
  clinicians determine when precisely seizures occur, and the parts of the brain that
  are most involved.
