abstract: 'The number of women requiring screening and diagnostic mammography is increasing.
  The recent promise of machine learning on medical images have led to an influx of
  studies using deep learning for autonomous mammogram diagnosis. We present a novel
  multi-view multi-task (MVMT) convolutional neural network (CNN) trained to predict
  the radiological assessments known to be associated with cancer, such as breast
  density, conspicuity, etc., in addition to cancer diagnosis. We show on full-eld
  mammograms that multi-task learning has three advantages: 1) learning refined feature
  representations associated with cancer improves the classification performance of
  the diagnosis task, 2) issuing radiological assessments provides an additional layer
  of model interpretability that a radiologist can use to debug and scrutinize the
  diagnoses provided by the CNN, and 3) improves the radiological workflow by providing
  automated annotation of radiological reports. Results obtained on a private dataset
  of over 7,000 patients show that our MVMT network attained an AUROC and AUPRC of
  0.855 $\pm$ 0.021 and 0.646 $\pm$ 0.023, respectively, and improved on the performance
  of other state-of-the-art multi-view CNNs.'
