abstract: To optimize clinical outcomes, fertility clinics must strategically select
  which embryos to transfer. Common selection heuristics are formulas expressed in
  terms of the durations required to reach various developmental milestones, quantities
  historically annotated manually by experienced embryologists based on time-lapse
  EmbryoScope videos. We propose a new method for automatic embryo staging that exploits
  several sources of structure in this time-lapse data. First, noting that in each
  image the embryo occupies a small subregion, we jointly train a region proposal
  network with the downstream classier to isolate the embryo. Notably, because we
  lack ground-truth bounding boxes, our we weakly supervise the region proposal network
  optimizing its parameters via reinforcement learning to improve the downstream classierâ€™s
  loss. Moreover, noting that embryos reaching the blastocyst stage progress monotonically
  through earlier stages, we develop a dynamic-programming-based decoder that post-processes
  our predictions to select the most likely monotonic sequence of developmental stages.
  Our methods outperform vanilla residual networks and rival the best numbers in contemporary
  papers, as measured by both per-frame accuracy and transition prediction error,
  despite operating on smaller data than many.
