abstract: 'Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are commonly applied to clinical time-series
  data with the goal of learning patient risk stratification models. Their effectiveness
  is due, in part, to their use of parameter sharing over time (i.e., cells are repeated
  hence the name recurrent ). We hypothesize, however, that this trait also contributes
  to the increased difficulty such models have with learning relationships that change
  over time. Conditional shift, i.e., changes in the relationship between the input
  X and the output y, arises when risk factors associated with the event of interest
  change over the course of a patient admission. While in theory, RNNs and gated RNNs
  (e.g., LSTMs) in particular should be capable of learning time-varying relationships,
  when training data are limited, such models often fail to accurately capture these
  dynamics. We illustrate the advantages and disadvantages of complete parameter sharing
  (RNNs) by comparing an LSTM with shared parameters to a sequential architecture
  with time-varying parameters on prediction tasks involving three clinically-relevant
  outcomes: acute respiratory failure (ARF), shock, and in-hospital mortality. In
  experiments using synthetic data, we demonstrate how parameter sharing in LSTMs
  leads to worse performance in the presence of conditional shift. To improve upon
  the dichotomy between complete parameter sharing and no parameter sharing, we propose
  a novel RNN formulation based on a mixture model in which we relax parameter sharing
  over time. The proposed method outperforms standard LSTMs and other state-of-the-art
  baselines across all tasks. In settings with limited data, relaxed parameter sharing
  can lead to improved patient risk stratification performance.'
