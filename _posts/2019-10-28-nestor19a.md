abstract: 'When training clinical prediction models from electronic health records
  (EHRs), a key concern should be a modelâ€™s ability to sustain performance over time
  when deployed, even as care practices, database systems, and population demographics
  evolve. Due to de-identification requirements, however, current experimental practices
  for public EHR benchmarks (such as the MIMIC-III critical care dataset) are time
  agnostic, assigning care records to train or test sets without regard for the actual
  dates of care. As a result, current benchmarks cannot assess how well models trained
  on one year generalise to another. In this work, we obtain a Limited Data Use Agreement
  to access year of care for each record in MIMIC and show that all tested state-of-the-art
  models decay in prediction quality when trained on historical data and tested on
  future data, particularly in response to a system-wide record-keeping change in
  2008 (0.29 drop in AUROC for mortality prediction, 0.10 drop in AUROC for length-of-stay
  prediction with a random forest classifier). We further develop a simple yet effective
  mitigation strategy: by aggregating raw features into expert-defined clinical concepts,
  we see only a 0.06 drop in AUROC for mortality prediction and a 0.03 drop in AUROC
  for length-of-stay prediction. We demonstrate that this aggregation strategy outperforms
  other automatic feature preprocessing techniques aimed at increasing robustness
  to data drift. We release our aggregated representations and code1 to encourage
  more deployable clinical prediction models.'
