abstract: Predicting drug-target interactions (DTI) is an essential part of the drug
  discovery process, which is an expensive process in terms of time and cost. Therefore,
  reducing DTI cost could lead to reduced healthcare costs for a patient. In addition,
  a precisely learned molecule representation in a DTI model could contribute to developing
  personalized medicine, which will help many patient cohorts. In this paper, we propose
  a new molecule representation based on the self-attention mechanism, and a new DTI
  model using our molecule representation. The experiments show that our DTI model
  outperforms the state of the art by up to 4.9% points in terms of area under the
  precision-recall curve. Moreover, a study using the DrugBank database proves that
  our model effectively lists all known drugs targeting a specific cancer biomarker
  in the top-30 candidate list.
