abstract: Disease phenotyping algorithms are designed to sift through clinical data
  stores to identify patients with specific diseases. Supervised phenotyping methods
  require significant quantities of expert-labeled data, while unsupervised methods
  may learn spurious or non-disease phenotypes. To address these limitations, we propose
  the Semi-Supervised Mixed Membership Model (SS3M) a probabilistic graphical model
  for learning disease phenotypes from partially labeled clinical data. We show SS3M
  can generate interpretable, disease-specific phenotypes which capture the clinical
  features of the disease concepts specified by the labels provided to the model.
  Furthermore, SS3M phenotypes demonstrate competitive predictive performance relative
  to commonly used baselines.
