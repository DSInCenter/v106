abstract: We consider preoperative prediction of thyroid cancer based on ultra-high-resolution
  whole-slide cytopathology images. Inspired by how human experts perform diagnosis,
  our approach first identifies and classifies diagnostic image regions containing
  informative thyroid cells, which only comprise a tiny fraction of the entire image.
  These local estimates are then aggregated into a single prediction of thyroid malignancy.
  Several unique characteristics of thyroid cytopathology guide our deep-learning-based
  approach. While our method is closely related to multiple-instance learning, it
  deviates from these methods by using a supervised procedure to extract diagnostically
  relevant regions. Moreover, we propose to simultaneously predict thyroid malignancy,
  as well as a diagnostic score assigned by a human expert, which further allows us
  to devise an improved training strategy. Experimental results show that the proposed
  algorithm achieves performance comparable to human experts, and demonstrate the
  potential of using the algorithm for screening and as an assistive tool for the
  improved diagnosis of indeterminate cases.
