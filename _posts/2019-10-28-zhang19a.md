abstract: 'The treatment effects of medications play a key role in guiding medical
  prescriptions. They are usually assessed with randomized controlled trials (RCTs),
  which are expensive. Recently, large-scale electronic health records (EHRs) have
  become available, opening up new opportunities for more cost-effective assessments.
  However, assessing a treatment effect from EHRs is challenging: it is biased by
  unobserved confounders , unmeasured variables that affect both patients’ medical
  prescription and their outcome, e.g. the patients’ social economic status. To adjust
  for unobserved confounders, we develop the medical deconfounder , a machine learning
  algorithm that unbiasedly estimates treatment effects from EHRs. The medical deconfounder
  first constructs a substitute confounder by modeling which medications were prescribed
  to each patient; this substitute confounder is guaranteed to capture all multi-medication
  confounders, observed or unobserved (Wang and Blei , 2018 ). It then uses this substitute
  confounder to adjust for the confounding bias in the analysis. We validate the medical
  deconfounder on two simulated and two real medical data sets. Compared to classical
  approaches, the medical deconfounder produces closer-to-truth treatment effect estimates;
  it also identifies effective medications that are more consistent with the findings
  in the medical literature.'
