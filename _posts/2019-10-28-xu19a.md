abstract: This study presents a multimodal machine learning model to predict ICD-10
  diagnostic codes. We developed separate machine learning models that can handle
  data from different modalities, including unstructured text, semi-structured text
  and structured tabular data. We further employed an ensemble method to integrate
  all modality-specific models to generate ICD codes. Key evidence was also extracted
  to make our prediction more convincing and explainable. We used the Medical Information
  Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) dataset to validate our approach. For ICD
  code prediction, our best-performing model (micro-F1 = 0.7633, micro-AUC = 0.9541)
  significantly outperforms other baseline models including TF-IDF (micro-F1 = 0.6721,
  micro-AUC = 0.7879) and Text-CNN model (micro-F1 = 0.6569, micro-AUC = 0.9235).
  For interpretability, our approach achieves a Jaccard Similarity Coecient (JSC)
  of 0.1806 on text data and 0.3105 on tabular data, where well-trained physicians
  achieve 0.2780 and 0.5002 respectively.
