abstract: Recently, researchers have started training high complexity machine learning
  models to clinical tasks, often improving upon previous benchmarks. However, more
  often than not, these methods require large amounts of supervision to provide good
  generalization guarantees. When applied to data coming from small cohorts and long
  monitoring periods these models are prone to overt to subject-identifying features.
  Since obtaining large amounts of labels is usually not practical in many scenarios,
  expert-driven knowledge of the task is a common technique to prevent overfitting.
  We present a two-step learning approach that is able to generalize under these circumstances
  when applied to a voice monitoring dataset. Our approach decouples the feature learning
  stage and performs it in an unsupervised manner, removing the need for laborious
  feature engineering. We show the effectiveness of our proposed model on two voice
  monitoring related tasks. We evaluate the extracted features for classifying between
  patients with vocal fold nodules and controls. We also demonstrate that the features
  capture pathology relevant information by showing that models trained on them are
  more accurate predicting vocal use for patients than for controls. Our proposed
  method is able to generalize to unseen subjects and across learning tasks while
  matching state-of-the-art results.
