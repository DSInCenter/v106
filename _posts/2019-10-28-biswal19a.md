abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is widely used in hospitals and clinics for
  the diagnosis of many neurological conditions. Such diagnoses require accurate and
  timely clinical reports to summarize the findings from raw EEG data. In this paper,
  we investigate whether it is possible to automatically generate text reports directly
  from EEG data. To address the challenges, we proposed EEGtoText , which first extracted
  shift invariant and temporal patterns using stacked convolutional neural networks
  and recurrent neural networks (RCNN). These temporal patterns are used to classify
  key phenotypes including EEG normality, sleep, generalized and focal slowing, epileptiform
  discharges, spindles, vertex waves and seizures. Based on these phenotypes, the
  impression section of the EEG report is generated. Next, we adopted a hierarchical
  long short-term memory network(LSTM) that comprises of paragraph-level and sentence-level
  LSTMs to generate the detail explanation of the impression. Within the hierarchical
  LSTM, we used an attention module to localize the abnormal areas in the EEG which
  provide another explanation and justification of the extracted phenotypes. We conducted
  large-scale evaluations on two different EEG datasets Dataset1 (n=12,980) and TUH
  (n=16,950). We achieved an area under the ROC curve (AUC) between .658 to .915 on
  phenotype classification, which is significantly higher than CRNN and RCNN with
  attention. We also conducted a quantitative evaluation of the detailed explanation,
  which achieved METEOR score .371 and BLEU score 4.583. Finally, our initial clinical
  reviews confirmed the effectiveness of the generated reports.
