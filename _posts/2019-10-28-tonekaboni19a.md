abstract: Translating machine learning (ML) models effectively to clinical practice
  requires establishing clinicians’ trust. Explainability, or the ability of an ML
  model to justify its outcomes and assist clinicians in rationalizing the model prediction,
  has been generally understood to be critical to establishing trust. However, the
  eld suffers from the lack of concrete definitions for usable explanations in different
  settings. To identify specific aspects of explainability that may catalyze building
  trust in ML models, we surveyed clinicians from two distinct acute care specialties
  (Intenstive Care Unit and Emergency Department). We use their feedback to characterize
  when explainability helps to improve clinicians’ trust in ML models. We further
  identify the classes of explanations that clinicians identified as most relevant
  and crucial for effective translation to clinical practice. Finally, we discern
  concrete metrics for rigorous evaluation of clinical explainability methods. By
  integrating perceptions of explainability between clinicians and ML researchers
  we hope to facilitate the endorsement and broader adoption and sustained use of
  ML systems in healthcare.
