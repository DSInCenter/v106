abstract: 'Brief, intense exercise can improve health due to its acute effect on the
  autonomic nervous system, particularly the sympathetic nervous system. Salivary
  amylase is a marker of sympathetic activity during exercise, but it requires specialized
  equipment to measure. We investigate the feasibility of estimating the amylase response
  from heartbeat data recorded by commodity sensors. We collect heartbeat and amylase
  data for n = 71 sessions of intense exercise performed in a commercial setting.
  Our machine learning model exploits structure in the heartbeat signal: by identifying
  and removing the contribution of the parasympathetic nervous system, we obtain a
  residual with sympathetic information, to which we apply a convolutional neural
  network. This model has better accuracy than existing measures of exercise response,
  such as maximum heart rate, even though it doesnâ€™t use metadata such as age and
  gender. This suggests sympathetic activity may be (weakly) discerned from heartbeat
  data. With a larger dataset, a practical measure of sympathetic response to exercise
  could potentially be developed. Our quantification of parasympathetic activity is
  more powerful than existing approaches and may have independent value.'
