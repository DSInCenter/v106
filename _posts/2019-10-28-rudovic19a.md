abstract: We introduce a novel personalized Gaussian Process Experts (pGPE) model
  for predicting per-subject ADAS-Cog13 cognitive scores – a significant predictor
  of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) in the cognitive domain – over the future 6, 12, 18,
  and 24 months. We start by training a population-level model using multi-modal data
  from previously seen subjects using a base Gaussian Process (GP) regression. Then,
  we personalize this model by adapting the base GP sequentially over time to a new
  (target) subject using domain adaptive GPs, and also by training subject-specific
  GP. While we show that these models achieve improved performance when selectively
  applied to the forecasting task (one performs better than the other on different
  subjects/visits), the average performance per model is suboptimal. To this end,
  we used the notion of meta learning in the proposed pGPE to design a regression-based
  weighting of these expert models, where the expert weights are optimized for each
  subject and his/her future visit. The results on a cohort of subjects from the ADNI
  dataset show that this newly introduced personalized weighting of the expert models
  leads to large improvements in accurately forecasting future ADAS-Cog13 scores and
  their fine-grained changes associated with the AD progression. This approach has
  potential to help identify at-risk patients early and improve the construction of
  clinical trials for AD.
