abstract: Clinical judgement studies are essential for recognising the causal relation
  of a medication with adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Traditionally, these studies
  are conducted via expert manual chart review. By contrast, we propose an end-to-end
  deep learning question answering model to automatically infer such causal relations.
  Our proposed model identifies the causal relation by answering a subset of Naranjo
  questionnaire Naranjo et al. (1981) from electronic health records. It employs multi-level
  attention layers along with local and global context while answering these questions.
  Our proposed model achieves a macro-weighted F-score of 0.4598 - 0.5142 across the
  selected questions and an overall F-score of 0.5011. We also did an ablation study
  to validate the importance of local and global context for the model.
