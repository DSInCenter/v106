abstract: Rapid detection of hemorrhage is of major interest to the critical care
  community, enabling clinicians to take swift actions to mitigate adverse outcomes.
  In this paper, we describe a model that allows rapid detection of the onset of hemorrhage
  by monitoring the Central Venous Pressure (CVP). As opposed to prior work in the
  domain, our model does not rely on prior availability of a stable physiology of
  a patient as a baseline of reference, and it makes generative assumptions on the
  monitored vital sign. This allows for rapid on-the-fly personalization to a previously
  unseen patientâ€™s physiology. This property makes the proposed approach particularly
  relevant to e.g. trauma care and other scenarios where reference hemodynamic data
  may not be readily available for any new patient. We compare our model against strong
  discriminative alternatives and demonstrate its potential utility through empirical
  evaluation.
