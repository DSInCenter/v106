abstract: The automatic generation of radiology reports given medical radiographs
  has significant potential to operationally and improve clinical patient care. A
  number of prior works have focused on this problem, employing advanced methods from
  computer vision and natural language generation to produce readable reports. However,
  these works often fail to account for the particular nuances of the radiology domain,
  and, in particular, the critical importance of clinical accuracy in the resulting
  generated reports. In this work, we present a domain-aware automatic chest X-ray
  radiology report generation system which first predicts what topics will be discussed
  in the report, then conditionally generates sentences corresponding to these topics.
  The resulting system is fine-tuned using reinforcement learning, considering both
  readability and clinical accuracy, as assessed by the proposed Clinically Coherent
  Reward. We verify this system on two datasets, Open-I and MIMICCXR, and demonstrate
  that our model offers marked improvements on both language generation metrics and
  CheXpert assessed accuracy over a variety of competitive baselines.
