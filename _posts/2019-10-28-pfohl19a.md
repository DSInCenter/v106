abstract: The use of machine learning systems to support decision making in healthcare
  raises questions as to what extent these systems may introduce or exacerbate disparities
  in care for historically underrepresented and mistreated groups, due to biases implicitly
  embedded in observational data in electronic health records. To address this problem
  in the context of clinical risk prediction models, we develop an augmented counterfactual
  fairness criteria that extends the group fairness criteria of equalized odds. We
  do so by requiring that the same prediction be made for a patient, and a counterfactual
  patient resulting from changing a sensitive attribute, if the factual and counterfactual
  outcomes do not differ. We investigate the extent to which the augmented counterfactual
  fairness criteria may be applied to develop fair models for prolonged inpatient
  length of stay and mortality with observational electronic health records data.
  As the fairness criteria is ill-defined without knowledge of the data generating
  process, we use a variational autoencoder to perform counterfactual inference in
  the context of an assumed causal graph. While our technique provides a means to
  trade off maintenance of fairness with reduction in predictive performance in the
  context of a learned generative model, further work is needed to assess the generality
  of this approach.
