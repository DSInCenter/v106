abstract: Sleep staging is a crucial task for diagnosing sleep disorders. It is tedious
  and complex as it can take a trained expert several hours to annotate just one patientâ€™s
  polysomnogram (PSG) from a single night. Although deep learning models have demonstrated
  state-of-the-art performance in automating sleep staging, interpretability which
  defines other desiderata, has largely remained unexplored. In this study, we propose
  Sleep staging via Prototypes from Expert Rules (SLEEPER ), which combines deep learning
  models with expert defined rules using a prototype learning framework to generate
  simple interpretable models. In particular, SLEEPER utilizes sleep scoring rules
  and expert defined features to derive prototypes which are embeddings of PSG data
  fragments via convolutional neural networks. The final models are simple interpretable
  models like a shallow decision tree defined over those phenotypes. We evaluated
  SLEEPER using two PSG datasets collected from sleep studies and demonstrated that
  SLEEPER could provide accurate sleep stage classification comparable to human experts
  and deep neural networks with about 85% ROC-AUC and .7 $\kappa$.
