abstract: 'Patients increasingly seek out information regarding their healthcare online.
  Online reviews of caregivers in particular may influence from whom patients seek
  treatment. Are these sources biased against female providers? To address this question
  we analyze a new dataset of online patient reviews of male and female healthcare
  providers with respect to numerical ratings and language use. We perform both regression
  and (data-driven) qualitative analyses of language via neural embedding models induced
  over review texts. In both cases we account for provider specialty. To do so while
  learning embeddings, we explicitly induce specialty, sex, and rating embeddings
  from review meta-data via a ‘matched-sampling’ training regime. We find that females
  consistently receive less favorable numerical ratings overall, even after adjusting
  for specialty. To analyze language use in reviews of male versus female providers,
  we induce neural embeddings (distributed representations) of gender and qualitatively
  characterize the ‘distributional semantics’ that this induces. We observe differences
  in language use, e.g., analysis of average vector similarities over repeated runs
  reveal that many of the words closest to the coordinates in embedding space associated
  with positive sentiment and female providers describe interpersonal characteristics
  (sweet , considerate , caring , personable , compassionate ): such descriptors do
  not seem as similar to the point corresponding to positive sentiment regarding male
  providers. To facilitate research in this direction we publicly release data, embeddings,
  and all code (including Jupyter notebooks) to reproduce our analyses and further
  explore the data: https://github.com/avi-jit/RateMDs.'
