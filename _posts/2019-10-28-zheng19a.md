abstract: Increasingly large observational datasets from healthcare and social media
  may allow new types of causal inference. However, these data are often missing key
  variables, increasing the chance of finding spurious causal relationships due to
  confounding. While methods exist for causal inference with latent variables in static
  cases, temporal relationships are more challenging, as varying time lags make latent
  causes more difficult to uncover and approaches often have significantly higher
  computational complexity. To address this, we make the key observation that while
  a variable may be latent in one dataset, it may be observed in another, or we may
  have domain knowledge about its effects. We propose a computationally efficient
  method that overcomes latent variables by using prior knowledge to reconstruct data
  for unobserved variables, while remaining robust to cases when the knowledge is
  wrong or does not apply. On simulated data, our approach outperforms the state of
  the art with a lower false discovery rate for causal inference. On real-world data
  from individuals with Type 1 diabetes, we show that our approach can discover causal
  relationships involving unmeasured meals and exercise.
