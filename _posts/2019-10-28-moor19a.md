abstract: 'Sepsis is a life-threatening host response to infection that is associated
  with high mortality, morbidity, and health costs. Its management is highly time-sensitive
  because each hour of delayed treatment increases mortality due to irreversible organ
  damage. Meanwhile, despite decades of clinical research, robust biomarkers for sepsis
  are missing. Therefore, detecting sepsis early by utilizing the affluence of high-resolution
  intensive care records has become a challenging machine learning problem. Recent
  advances in deep learning and data mining promise to deliver a powerful set of tools
  to efficiently address this task. This empirical study proposes two novel approaches
  for the early detection of sepsis: a deep learning model and a lazy learner that
  is based on time series distances. Our deep learning model employs a temporal convolutional
  network that is embedded in a multi-task Gaussian Process adapter framework, making
  it directly applicable to irregularly-spaced time series data. In contrast, our
  lazy learner is an ensemble approach that employs dynamic time warping. We frame
  the timely detection of sepsis as a supervised time series classification task.
  Consequently, we derive the most recent sepsis definition in an hourly resolution
  to provide the first fully accessible early sepsis detection environment. Seven
  hours before sepsis onset, our methods improve area under the precisionâ€“recall curve
  from 0.25 to 0.35 and 0.40, respectively, over the state of the art. This demonstrates
  that they are well-suited for detecting sepsis in the crucial earlier stages when
  management is most effective.'
